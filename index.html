      <h2 style="text-align: center">A Blind Man's Favourite Shoes</h2>
      <p style="">
        Blind people have difficulty navigating, which is obvious, considering
        that they have lost the ability to see, they can't know where they're
        going, where they're walking to, and where they're currently at. This is
        where the Smart Shoes, for the blind, come into play. With a built in
        camera, sensor, and many other cool technologies, it greatly assists the
        blind with transporting themselves.

        style="border-radius: 10%; height: 400px; padding-left: 2em"
      />
      <p>
        The camera on the front of the shoe detects any obstacles in the way and
        sends a directional actuation/vibration to the wearer, letting them know
        that there is an obstacle in the way, and that they should redirect. The
        shoes are also made of sturdy material, so in the case of a visually
        impaired person colliding with an obstacle, the sturdy material ensures
        that the blind person won't be harmed or injured, as they would if they
        were wearing a normal shoe. <br /><br />Furthermore, the shoe would also
        have a built-in GPS system, and bluetooth connection, so once the user
        decides where they want to go, the shoe automatically decides the
        fastest and safest route to get there, and begins using directional
        actuations and vibrations to let the user know when to turn and where to
        go. In the case of the user going the wrong direction, and it being too
        late to continue with the intended route, the shoe will automatically
        decide the next shortest route and redirection to get to the wanted
        destination. <br /><br />The shoe also may have a temperature detector
        to detect fires and hazardous materials, and telling the user to
        redirect. This can also be accompanied with a detector to check for
        water and rain, so for example if the user is walking into a deep
        puddle, the shoes detect the puddle and redirect.
